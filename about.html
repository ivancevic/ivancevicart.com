          <p>
            Marko is a painter of seascapes, landscapes and animal subjects,
            primarily in acrylic, watercolour and pastels. Personal observation
            and experience of the subject matter are key to his work. He tries
            to capture the play of colour and light in landscape, and his
            paintings are instantly recognizable to the bold, dymanic
            brushstrokes, all conveying a sense of activity to his artwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            From aquarell pens on paper to oil on canvas, in the learning
            process there is no place for one direction or one material. Various
            techniques can be seen in the gallery of his paintings as well as
            various materials that he uses.
          </p>
          <p>He works from his own home studio in Vienna, Österreich.</p>
          <p>Member of the group of Urban Sketchers in Vienna.</p>

          <h3>Plein Air</h3>
          <p>
            There are few things more pleasurable than sitting quietly in
            nature, looking at a view with a paint box in your lap and your
            favourite brushes or pencils in hand. It really gets you soaking up
            the atmosphere and there's no better way to charge your senses!
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also excellent practice and discipline. Being on location,
            with the sun, the clouds, the wind and rain force you to use all
            your powers of observation and to be in the moment.

          <h3>Urban Sketchers</h3>
          <p>
            (USk) is a global community of artists that practice drawing on
            location in cities, towns and villages they live in or travel to.
            The Urban Sketchers movement was started on Flickr in 2007 by
            journalist Gabriel Campanario. In 2009 Campanario established Urban
            Sketchers as a nonprofit organization (501 (c) (3) tax-exempt). The
            Urban Sketchers Manifesto has been translated into several
            languages.
          </p>
          <p>The USk motto is “We show the world, one drawing at a time!”</p>

          <h3>Landscapes</h3>
          <p>
            Salvador Dalí once made a comparison of great painters. He rated
            each for his colors, drawing, invention, and other qualities. For
            “mystery” he gave Leonardo da Vinci a 10. Isn’t that one of
            Leonardo’s fortes?
          </p>
          <p>
            The landscapes in his paintings have much to do with the mystery.
            Some are troubling—spooky—fantasy worlds. (The philosopher Kant
            makes schrecklich–terrifying–one of the qualities of the sublime.)
            Others are outright paradises.
